`rainbowpath` is a program for making paths pretty. It can be used to make pretty
shell prompts:

`rainbowpath` formats supplied path by coloring each path component with a color
selected from a palette. Colors for path components are selected based on the
order they appear in the palette. If no palette is supplied a default one will
be used. `rainbowpath` should work on any modern terminal emulator that supports
256 colors. When invoked without a path `rainbowpath` displays the current
working directory.

### Installation

Statically linked release binaries are available on GitHub [releases
page](https://github.com/Soft/rainbowpath/releases). These should work on most
modern Linux systems. For Arch Linux, `rainbowpath` is also available on
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rainbowpath/).

### Building

```shell
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

### Usage

```
Usage: rainbowpath [-p PALETTE] [-s STYLE] [-S STRING] [-l] [-c] [-n] [-b] [-h] [-v] [PATH]
Color path components using a palette.

Options:
  -p, --palette=PALETTE             Semicolon-separated list of styles for
                                    path components
  -s, --separator=STYLE             Style for path separators
  -S, --separator-string=SEPARATOR  String used to separate path components
                                    in the output (defaults to '/')
  -l, --leading                     Do not display leading path separator
  -c, --compact                     Replace home directory path prefix with ~
  -n, --newline                     Do not append newline
  -b, --bash                        Escape control codes for use in Bash prompts
  -h, --help                        Display this help
  -v, --version                     Display version information
```

### Use in a Bash prompt

In Bash, what appears in the shell prompt can be controlled using the `PS1`
variable. In addition, `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable can be used to execute commands
before the prompt is displayed. This mechanism can be used to dynamically modify
the prompt using external commands. For example, to include `rainbowpath` output
into the shell prompt, we could define the following function:

```shell
function reset-prompt {
  PS1="\u@\h $(rainbowpath -b) \$ "
}

PROMPT_COMMAND=reset-prompt
```

With this setup, `rainbowpath` will be executed every time prompt is about to be
displayed and the output included into the prompt string.

### Styles

Styles specify how path components should look. `--palette` and `--separator`
options accept styles as arguments. Style consists of a list of properties
separated by commas. The possible properties are:

| Property     | Description                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `fg=COLOR`   | Set text color to `COLOR`       |
| `bg=COLOR`   | Set background color to `COLOR` |
| `bold`       | Bold font                       |
| `dim`        | Dim color                       |
| `underlined` | Underlined text                 |
| `blink`      | Blinking text                   |

Where `COLOR` is an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, the following invocation will display the current working
directory's path altering path components' styles between underlined green (2)
and bold yellow (3) on magenta (5) background:

``` shell
rainbowpath --palette 'fg=2,underlined;fg=3,bg=5,bold'
```
